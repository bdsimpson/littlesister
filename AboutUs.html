<p align="justify"><font size="4">At Little Sister Productions we bring 
entertainment to you. Our company makes you a star in front of all your friends, 
family or Co-Workers. We have a large selection of songs for you to sing. We can 
handle small groups or large stage performances. There are a lot of people 
trying to imitate Little Sister Productions, but there is only one. That's why 
we are one of the leading karaoke and disc jockey entertainment services in the 
DFW area since 1991.<br>
<br>
You need a company with a professional DJ who knows how to perform for a group 
of people. We offer a professional yet friendly approach dealing with people, 
even those people who are shy in singing themselves. All of our words of our 
songs come up on a monitor ready for you to sing. Don't despair for we can 
entertain you ourselves by singing &quot;all-time&quot; favorites that should have your 
feet tapping. You will find your stage fright does not last long you enjoy the 
incredible response that only our karaoke crowds can provide.<br>
<br>
We use high quality state of the art studio equipment that will give all the top 
quality sound you need for your party.<br>
<br>
Our karaoke and disc jockey libraries are extensive. We have four complete 
systems available, carefully chosen to integrate only the best in sound quality. 
There are currently two lighting systems available to spotlight entertainers. 
Our team of DJ's are all technologically trained ensuring that singers receive 
the proper EQ and effects for their voices, thus providing the best performance 
setting. All are familiar with current music trends and can satisfy your patrons 
with country, current rock, 70's and 80's rock and dance music.<br>
<br>
With Little Sister Productions, the focus is on the performers and not on the 
individual hosts, who guide the audience through the event, promoting everything 
from food &amp; beverage sales to upcoming special events. To keep the atmosphere 
flowing between singers, we provide a variety of music between each singer 
designed to keep all in the mood for fun!<br>
<br>
Our shows are four hours in length. Singers can choose their selections from our 
extensive neatly bound and organized songbooks or from our lap top computers, 
alphabetized by both song title and artist and providing over 70,000 selections 
from which to choose. Singers turn in their selection on a sign-up slip to the 
host and await their turn. After the first round of singers has performed, a new 
singer is added between each repeat singer, thus ensuring that everyone gets a 
chance to sing.<br>
<br>
Our hosts are not allowed to play favorites among singers. In this way, our 
patrons keep coming back, knowing that they will be fairly treated.<br>
<br>
We customize our rates to suit your establishment needs and expected volume, 
taking into account the growth we expect to see in your business as a result of 
the sales we bring to you. However, as a new establishment to our show list, we 
gradually allow the show to build before the final pricing and incentive bonus 
is established with a firm commitment for eight weeks. We usually allow a 4 week 
growth period, beginning with a discounted price and slowly increasing our price 
with the increase of your business. At the end of the eight week period, we will 
discuss the profitability and success of our shows to your business and arrive 
at a mutually acceptable bonus level by which both parties benefit when both 
parties are successful. This allows each party to stay focused on growth and 
enjoy the success together. </font></p>
